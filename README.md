# secession

*Secession* is a real-time, single and multi-player combat simulation that operates as a modification to the game [Running With Rifles](http://www.runningwithrifles.com). Each player takes part in skirmishes occurring on various battlefields, and must choose to ally or engage in combat with other players in an effort to establish majority control of key locations in the game world.

### Story
Secession is adaptable to portray any time or level of technology. This variant has a futuristic setting and its events take place on an planet not unlike earth, but one that can be likened more to a gladiatorial ring than a populated world with its own economy and laws.

Five major corporations &mdash; vying for status and the right to provide security services to intergalactic governmental icons and celebrities &mdash; use this planet to showcase their staff's abilities and training. Unfortunately, the known universe exists in a time of greed, where one's allegiance is to the highest bidder. Mercenary teams that prove their worth to one corporation are prime candidates for assimilation within another.

There are subtle differences in the training regimes of each of the corporations, encouraging some mercenary teams to remain loyal to the one employer. On the other hand, subjects with existing skills in an associated field will often complete another corporation's training course in a matter of days in their spare time. Mercenary units that have worked for and trained under multiple corporations &mdash; while rarely held in high regard by their past employers &mdash; can hold a decisive advantage over their opponents on the battlefield.

Beyond the conflict occuring between the corporations, a media presence known as the 'Broadcast News Network' (`BNN`) keeps the inhabitants informed on matters ranging from places of interest to each corporation's overall performance and other statistics. The BNN even finds time to sneak in the odd product advertisement, but many rumour these are in fact encrypted transimissions.

### Game Setup
1. Each player chooses a corporation to ally with:
  * `BlastCorp` are leaders in the explosives field
  * `LifeCraft` specialises in survival skills and medical procedures
  * `ReflexArq` uses a system that improves the reflexes of its subjects
  * `ScopeSystems` develops long-range targeting equipment
  * `WyreTek` have created an advanced communications network
  
2. The game server selects a starting map and location for the player based on the selected corporation. 

3. The player spawns as one of the following character types, each of which having its own `Offence`, `Defence`, and `Command` Ratings:
  * `Light Foot`
  * `Heavy Trooper`
  * `Sniper`
  * `Grenadier`
  * `Demolition Trooper`
  * `Medic`
  * `Communications Technician`

### Game Play
#### Primary and Secondary objectives:
Each area in the *Secession* world has a number of zones that need to be captured and controlled by a corporation (or alliance) before the area is marked on the world map as owned by that entity. When sufficient zones have been captured by the player's faction, victory is achieved in that area and adjacent areas are made available for conquest. If the player's faction can conquer enough areas in the world map they can begin to launch attacks on the opposing factions' headquarters. Successful attacks on these areas allow the victor to inherit all of the defeated faction's technologies. The defeated faction is removed from the game world completely.

Conversely, if an area encounter results in the player's faction losing control of too many zones, they are forced to retreat to an adjacent area still under their control. If none remains, the player is absorbed by the opposing faction and granted powers equivalent to that of a new recruit.

Throughout every encounter, each corporation's command staff advise mercenaries which targets and locations in the current area are of most interest. The map overlay is updated accordingly so that players can immediately see where the bulk of their team is focussing its efforts. Players are encouraged to support their AI-controlled teammates in achieving these objectives, but are free to operate as they wish while the greater area is being contested.

Players should be aware that other factions will be fighting for control of other areas while the area the player is located in is being contested. The world map may show significant changes in possession at the conclusion of each skirmish. With this in mind, it is vital for players to ensure their faction's territorial holdings are solidly defended before attempting to take over more areas. 

#### Tertiary objectives
The BNN posts regular announcements over the airwaves, advising listeners of locations of interest in their current area and statistics pertaining to the greater world. Mercenaries can investigate reports of misplaced supply drops or attempt high-risk missions that have been posted by external parties. Forming friendships outside of the major corporations can earn players a healthy side-income and may even allow them to gain access to unknown or experimental technologies that can improve their performance in combat, transport, or trade.

#### Experience Points (XP)

#### Resource Points (RP)
As players gain skill and complete tasks they can customise their character's abilities by spending `Resource Points` at upgrade centres.

Players can access a tactical map at any time to see the status of the action in their local area as well as the greater world. Even though a corporation may be able to hold one area without difficultly, there are numerous other areas that must be conquered and controlled to guarantee supply lines and ultimately claim victory over the other corporations.

#### Rules
Each area of the world map has an associated `Resource Rating`, calculated by its land type and fortifications. While more than one corporation may be present in each world area, the combined `Command Rating` of allied units may not exceed the `Resource Rating` of the area. This rule presents a significant challenge for corporations that engage in alliances or pacts; each allied corporation's effective presence in world areas will be reduced by half or more if their allies wish to occupy the area as well.

#### Selling Points
* Take command of a small group of mercenaries in a battle for planetary resources and possession.
* Align yourself with a number of corporations and take advantage of their distinct combat bonuses.
* Coordinate your team's movement with your allies to gain the upper hand in skirmishes.
* Hire specialist units to your team and use their skills to strategically conquer various battlefields.
* Step back from the front lines and take part in dangerous but lucrative contract missions.
